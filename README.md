# TFC-Farming
## Overview

This addon adds something similar to the soil nutrient mechanic, with some changes, that was present in 1.7.10 TFC. Each plant has their favorite nutrient either N, P or K, you can check it by pressing shift while viewing their respective see's tooltip. Once the player reaches the "Adept" skill level for agriculture, they can sneak while holding a hoe and looking at a block to see the nutrient values of that specific block.

## Mechanics and details

- Each crop consumes all of its favorite nutrient from the soil to grow from 0% to maturity.



- A farmland will passively gain about 3.14% of each nutrient every TFC month. That means that to go from to 0% to 100% it takes 32 ingame months.

  - If for example a crop which uses the N nutrient is planted then that piece of soil won't regenerate the N nutrient.

  - This enables the strategy of splitting the land in 3 (or more) pieces and rotating the crops based on their favorite nutrient each season, in temperate regions.
     
     - In TFC each crop takes ~4 months to mature



- A mature crop will still use nutrients, so make sure you harvest them.

- A dead crop left on a piece of land will cause a -20% drop to the passive nutrient growth.



- Fertilizers are present for each nutrient which upon use increase their specific nutrient value by 50%.

  - The item called "Fertilizer" in TFC is now the fertilizer for the K nutrient, saltpeter is the N nutrient and the mod adds a new item for the P nutrient.

  - If you search "fertilizer" in JEI you can check all three of them.
